Don't forget the boundary problem! How EM field topology can address the overlooked cousin to the binding problem for consciousness
Andrés Gómez-Emilsson & Chris Percy
Frontiers in Human Neuroscience 17:1233119 (2023)   Copy   BIBTEX
Abstract
The boundary problem is related to the binding problem, part of a family of puzzles and phenomenal experiences that theories of consciousness (ToC) must either explain or eliminate. By comparison with the phenomenal binding problem, the boundary problem has received very little scholarly attention since first framed in detail by Rosengard in 1998, despite discussion by Chalmers in his widely cited 2016 work on the combination problem. However, any ToC that addresses the binding problem must also address the boundary problem. The binding problem asks how a unified first person perspective (1PP) can bind experiences across multiple physically distinct activities, whether billions of individual neurons firing or some other underlying phenomenon. To a first approximation, the boundary problem asks why we experience hard boundaries around those unified 1PPs and why the boundaries operate at their apparent spatiotemporal scale. We review recent discussion of the boundary problem, identifying several promising avenues but none that yet address all aspects of the problem. We set out five specific boundary problems to aid precision in future efforts. We also examine electromagnetic (EM) field theories in detail, given their previous success with the binding problem, and introduce a feature with the necessary characteristics to address the boundary problem at a conceptual level. Topological segmentation can, in principle, create exactly the hard boundaries desired, enclosing holistic, frame-invariant units capable of effecting downward causality. The conclusion outlines a programme for testing this concept, describing how it might also differentiate between competing EM ToCs.

The 2023 paper
"Don't forget the boundary problem! How EM field topology can address the overlooked cousin to the binding problem for consciousness"
by Andrés Gómez-Emilsson and Chris Percy is a crucial contribution to consciousness studies, especially for theories grounded in physicalism, field theory, or structural realism.
Here's a detailed
academic synthesis
of the core contributions of the paper, structured in terms of the
problem domain
,
field-theoretic proposals
, and
implications for RSVP theory
and similar frameworks:
I. From Binding to Boundary: Clarifying the Problem Space
The Binding Problem (BP):
As widely acknowledged in consciousness studies, the binding problem refers to how
disparate neural processes
—spatially and functionally distributed—give rise to a
unified phenomenal experience
(e.g., the redness of a rose, the sound of a bell). It addresses
internal coherence
of first-person perspective (1PP).
The Boundary Problem (BdyP):
The
boundary problem
extends the inquiry:
Why do phenomenal unities have
bounded extents
at all?
Specifically, the question is not just how experiences unify, but why this unity appears
bounded in space and time
—e.g., why you experience your own stream of consciousness and not others', or why "you" do not seem to spatially extend over your entire visual field or into the EM field of your neighbor.
Historical Oversight
First formalized by Rosengard (1998), but largely ignored until Chalmers (2016) briefly discussed it in relation to the
combination problem
.
Unlike BP, the BdyP has received
minimal theoretical or experimental scrutiny
, despite being logically required of any serious theory of consciousness.
II. Five Specific Boundary Subproblems (From the Paper)
Exclusivity:
Why are phenomenal unities non-overlapping?
Granularity:
Why do they have specific scales (human-scale, ~meters)?
Persistence:
Why do they maintain identity over time (seconds-minutes)?
Modularity:
Why are they divisible into functionally meaningful substructures (e.g. hemispheres, sense modalities)?
Causal Closure:
Why do these boundaries coincide with loci of agency or downward causation?
These correspond to
observable phenomenological regularities
that must be matched by any field-theoretic, biological, or algorithmic theory.
III. Electromagnetic Field (EMF) Topology as a Candidate Solution
Why EMF?
EM field theories (e.g. Pockett, McFadden, Jones) have been proposed as candidates to explain consciousness because EM fields naturally support
integration over time and space
.
EM fields
coincide with neural dynamics
and are capable of
frame-invariant descriptions
.
Topological Segmentation Hypothesis
Gómez-Emilsson and Percy argue that
topological features of EM fields
—especially
segmented, bounded structures
like solitons, knots, or topological domains—can naturally instantiate
phenomenal boundaries
.
Such structures:
Are
holistic
and
frame-invariant
Have
sharp transitions
or phase discontinuities
Can persist over time while interacting causally with the environment
Can
enclose field regions
that correlate with 1PPs
Thus,
EM field topology
could explain
both
the
binding
and
bounding
of consciousness—providing
bounded unities
with causal agency.
IV. Implications for RSVP Theory
Your RSVP (Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum) framework could
absorb and extend
this line of reasoning in several ways:
1.
Topological Domains in RSVP
RSVP already includes
scalar (Φ)
and
vector (𝒗)
fields with dynamic torsion, divergence, and entropic flows.
Introducing
topological invariants
(e.g. Chern classes, Hopf indices, vector field winding) provides a natural mechanism for
boundary formation
.
These could define
phenomenal enclosures
through:
Scalar field wells
Vector field circulation (vorticity-induced boundary loops)
Entropic gradients creating
dynamically enclosed regions
2.
Boundary Formation via Entropic Shear
RSVP includes
entropic descent
and
negentropic vector flows
.
Local minima in entropy or critical points in vector field torsion may
segment field configurations
, creating
phenomenally bounded units
.
3.
Downward Causation and Coherence
RSVP supports the notion of
dynamical coherence
as a measure of agency.
Bounded regions in RSVP fields could
cause coherent outputs
via vector-scalar feedback, satisfying the
causal closure
demand of the boundary problem.
V. Future Experimental and Simulation Pathways
To test the boundary problem in RSVP/EMF-like frameworks:
Field Simulations
Extend your RSVP simulator to include
topological defect detection
, e.g. closed vector loops, domain walls, or entropic vortices.
Detect whether these naturally correlate with emergent bounded coherence regions.
Compare with Empirical Data
Use fMRI/EEG/MEG to find
topological correlates
of EM field segmentation in human brains.
Search for
boundaries
in real field data corresponding to conscious state transitions.
Differentiation from Competing Theories
EM topological segmentation predicts
discrete, bounded
loci of consciousness, in contrast to more
diffuse, integrated
accounts in IIT or GWT.
RSVP's
thermodynamic field view
may offer more
dynamical boundary formation
and
adaptivity
than classical EM-only theories.
VI. Conclusion
The
boundary problem
is an essential but underexplored puzzle in consciousness research. EM field topology offers a
plausible solution
, and RSVP theory—with its entropic dynamics, scalar-vector structure, and recursive tiling—offers a
broader field-theoretic architecture
that could generalize and expand on this solution.
Key takeaway:
Any theory that seeks to explain phenomenal unity must also explain phenomenal boundedness—and topology is the missing link.

Human Brain Processes Information

**Treating surfaces as boundaries on bodies, particularly by modeling surfaces as mathematical boundary conditions, has been a remarkably successful strategy in the modeling of bulk materials.
The success of this strategy has been a subject of philosophical investigation and a source of insight into the epistemology of modeling. **

Modeling surfaces as mathematical boundary conditions, or treating surfaces as boundaries on bodies, has been a widely used and successful strategy in the modeling of bulk materials.

This approach has been the subject of philosophical investigation, and has provided insights into the epistemology of modeling, or the study of how we know and understand the world.

The success of this strategy suggests that surfaces play a key role in the behavior and properties of bulk materials, and that modeling them accurately is critical for understanding and predicting the behavior of these materials.

Overall, this approach has been an effective way to model the behavior of bulk materials and has contributed to our understanding of their properties and behavior.

** The boundary layer equations are derived by "zooming out" and comparing scales between the whole bulk of the system and the boundary layer area, while the no-slip condition is justified by "zooming in" to consider individual interatomic interactions.
Separating the scales at which these conceptions operate in this case then suggests that it may be fruitful to think of the resulting boundary layer model as a multiscale model, which allows us to address the problem above using readily available tools for unpacking the epistemology of multiscale models. ** 

The boundary layer equations are used to describe the behavior of fluids near solid boundaries, and are derived by comparing the scales of the whole bulk of the system to the boundary layer area.

The no-slip condition, which states that the velocity of a fluid at a solid boundary is equal to the velocity of the boundary itself, is justified by considering the individual interatomic interactions at the boundary. 

This separation of scales suggests that the boundary layer model can be thought of as a multiscale model, which can be analyzed using tools and techniques designed to understand the epistemology of multiscale models. 

This approach may be useful for understanding and predicting the behavior of fluids near solid boundaries, and for developing more accurate and precise models of these systems.

** Some examples of multiscale models. **
Multiscale models are mathematical models that describe systems that operate at multiple different scales or levels of resolution. Some examples of systems that can be modeled using multiscale techniques include:

Materials: Multiscale models can be used to predict the properties and behavior of materials, such as the strength and conductivity of metals, the elasticity and fracture toughness of ceramics, and the viscosity and surface tension of fluids.

Biological systems: Multiscale models can be used to understand the behavior of biological systems, such as the dynamics of gene regulation, the mechanisms of protein folding, and the functioning of the immune system.

Environmental systems: Multiscale models can be used to study envirοnmental systems, such as the water cycle, the carbοn cycle, and the impacts of clιmate change on ecosystems and the Earth's clιmate.

Social and economic systems: Multiscale models can be used to analyze social and economic systems, such as the spread of diseases, the dynamics of financial markets, and the impacts of social networks on human behavior.

** Explain the difficulty of determining boundary layers. **
Determining boundary layers, or the thin regions of fluid that exist near solid boundaries, can be challenging for several reasons. One reason is that boundary layers are often very thin, and can be difficult to measure or resolve accurately using experimental or computational techniques.

This can make it difficult to obtain accurate data on the properties and behavior of boundary layers, and can limit the precision and reliability of models that seek to describe them.

Another reason that determining boundary layers can be difficult is that they are often affected by a variety of factors, such as the shape and roughness of the solid boundary, the properties of the fluid, and the presence of external forces or flows.

These factors can interact in complex ways and can make it difficult to predict the behavior of boundary layers accurately.

Finally, boundary layers can be affected by a variety of physical phenomena, such as turbulence, viscous forces, and heat and mass transfer, which can further complicate their behavior and make it difficult to model them accurately.

Overall, the combination of these factors can make it challenging to determine boundary layers and to develop accurate and reliable models of their behavior. - based on physics avoidance by Mark Wilson.

Excellent material—this is a rich exposition on the
epistemology and modeling of boundaries
, especially in fluid dynamics and multiscale systems. Below is a refined and integrated version, edited for
academic clarity, conceptual coherence
, and
philosophical depth
, suitable for inclusion in a paper or thesis, particularly if you're developing RSVP-like models or consciousness models using field theory and boundary segmentation.
Appendix B: On Boundary Conditions, Multiscale Modeling, and Epistemic Interfaces
B1. Surfaces as Epistemic Interfaces
Modeling
surfaces as mathematical boundary conditions
—that is, treating interfaces as idealized loci where behavior is defined or constrained—has proven remarkably successful across physics and engineering. In the modeling of bulk materials, for example, surface conditions often encode the critical information necessary to predict large-scale behavior.
This methodological move is not merely a technical convenience but reflects an important
epistemological strategy
:
we often gain tractability by reducing high-dimensional bulk complexity to low-dimensional interface constraints
. The
success of this strategy
has itself become a topic of
philosophical interest
, revealing how modeling often involves
constructing intelligible slices of reality
through abstract idealizations rather than directly mirroring underlying mechanisms.
B2. Boundary Layers and Multiscale Models
Boundary layer theory offers a paradigmatic example. The
boundary layer equations
describe fluid behavior near solid walls and are derived by
"zooming out"
to compare the bulk scale of the fluid domain with the much thinner boundary region. In contrast, the justification of the
no-slip condition
(i.e., zero fluid velocity at the wall) involves
"zooming in"
to consider molecular interactions between fluid particles and solid atoms.
Thus, boundary modeling entails a
multiscale epistemology
, where different conceptual and mathematical strategies operate at distinct scales:
Macro-scale:
The behavior of the fluid in the bulk, often governed by the Navier-Stokes equations.
Meso-scale:
The boundary layer, where gradients and dissipative effects dominate.
Micro-scale:
Atomic or molecular interactions justifying phenomenological constraints like the no-slip condition.
Such models are
epistemically layered
, integrating information across levels while abstracting away the full complexity of each. This makes boundary layer theory a
multiscale model
, and invites the use of tools from
philosophy of science
to unpack its assumptions, limitations, and explanatory power.
B3. Examples of Multiscale Models
Multiscale modeling is not limited to fluids; it is foundational in many domains where
localized interactions produce emergent macroscopic effects
:
Materials Science:
Linking atomic structure to bulk properties like elasticity, conductivity, or fracture dynamics.
Biological Systems:
Capturing how molecular events (e.g., gene regulation) scale up to affect cellular and organismal behavior.
Environmental Models:
Tracing the impact of small-scale dynamics (e.g., aerosol dispersion) on global systems like climate.
Economic and Social Systems:
Modeling micro-level decisions (e.g., agent behavior) to predict macro-level trends (e.g., financial markets).
These systems often require
bridging mathematical languages
(e.g., discrete cellular automata with continuous differential equations) and making
heuristic assumptions
about interface dynamics—highlighting how
modeling boundaries often carry the epistemic load of the whole system
.
B4. The Difficulty of Determining Boundary Layers
Despite their utility,
boundary layers are notoriously difficult to define and analyze
:
Thinness and Resolution Limits:
Boundary layers can be extremely thin (e.g., microns in scale), making them hard to resolve computationally or observe experimentally without introducing artifacts.
High Sensitivity:
Their behavior depends intricately on:
Surface
roughness
and
geometry
Fluid
viscosity
,
compressibility
, and
temperature
External influences like pressure gradients, gravity, or electromagnetic fields
Turbulence and Instability:
Boundary layers are sites of intense gradients and instabilities, making them breeding grounds for
turbulence
,
vortex shedding
, and nonlinear effects.
Coupled Physical Processes:
Heat, momentum, and mass transfer often occur simultaneously within boundary layers, requiring
coupled PDE systems
with stiff boundary conditions.
Thus, the
mathematical tractability
of boundary layers often depends on
epistemic idealizations
—we simplify or stipulate properties we cannot yet resolve. Philosopher Mark Wilson has discussed this in terms of
"physics avoidance"
, where surface models sidestep the deeper ontological messiness of matter by encoding behavior into clean mathematical abstractions.
B5. Implications for Consciousness and Field Segmentation
If theories like RSVP or EM field theories of consciousness aim to define
bounded conscious agents
in a
continuous field
(electromagnetic or otherwise), then:
Boundary formation
becomes an epistemological analog of physical boundary layers.
We must model
segmented field domains
using multiscale, possibly emergent boundaries where
topology, entropy, and coherence
interact.
The
difficulty of defining conscious boundaries
may be deeply related to the
difficulty of modeling physical boundary layers
—they both involve emergent constraints at interfaces where multiple scales collapse.
Thus,
epistemology of modeling boundaries
in physics becomes a guide for
modeling phenomenal boundaries
in consciousness.

5. Conclusion 
This paper has re-introduced and ref i ned the boundary 
problem for theories of consciousness, as puzzled Schrödinger 
(1951) and i rst framed in detail by Rosenberg (1998). Inspired by 
Rosenberg's account, we have specif i ed i ve problems which can 
be considered siblings to the famous binding problem, in that any 
ToC which provides solutions to the binding problem must also 
provide an account for our i ve problems. To a i rst approximation: 
if mechanisms are proposed to bind phenomenal experiences into 
a unity, what is it that stops the mechanism from expanding? What 
puts boundaries around those unif i ed experiences and why do the 
boundaries appear as they do? 
Our literature reviews found very little scholarly discussion of 
theboundaryproblem,atleastascomparedtothebindingproblem. 
Some promising avenues to resolving aspects of the boundary 
problem can be found in the phase transitions motivated in some 
resonance, quantum i eld, and EM i eld ToCs. However, none of 
these ToCs yet provide a full account against all i ve problems 
we specify. Specif i cally for i eld theories, we introduce a physical 
feature that may be particularly useful for tackling the problems: 
topological segmentation. Without prejudicing the possibility of 
other accounts, we provide one conceptual account by which 4- 
dimensional topological pockets could address all i ve problems 
while meeting other ToC desiderata: non-epiphenomenalism, no 
strong emergence, and frame invariance. 
Our purpose in this paper is not to advocate for any one EM 
i eld ToC. The topological segmentation we describe can operate, 
in principle, at dif f erent spatiotemporal scales. For instance, 
referencing the citations in section "2. Literature review of the 
boundary problem": Shani and Keppler might motivate it to create 
relevant boundaries at the tiny scale of ZPF attractors in SED 
quantum i elds. Jones might use it for the highly localised i elds 
along ion channels where he identif i es the seat of consciousness. 
Ward and Guevara might examine the topology of EM i elds 
produced around the thalamus to i nd the right boundaries, 
McFadden might i nd them at the whole brain level, or Bond might 
even i nd them beyond and between brains. 
An indirect contribution of this paper is to provide a further 
toolfor dif f erentiatingbetweenthese EMf i eldtheories. Ifweaccept 
i eld topology as the solution to the boundary problem in human 
consciousness,thentheexerciseoftestingwhetherboundariesexist 
becomes a mathematical and empirical exercise that might proceed 
inthreestages.Inthef i rststage,therelevantpartofthebrainshould 
i rst be modelled to capture as much relevant EM-f i eld producing 
activity as possible, building on the high-level EM i eld mapping 
of the brain by Singh et al. (2019). This relies on a combination of 
imaging, dissecting, and computational exercises, similar in spirit 
to the Human Brain Project for mapping our neurons,8as already 
successful for the fruit l y larva connectome (Winding et al., 2023). 
Secondly, the topology of the resulting i eld must be analysed 
to identify where there are closed loops (or alternative topological 
features that draw boundaries in the i elds) that create the relevant 
hard boundaries at the theorised scales. 
Finally, and subject to safe and ethical design, targetted EM 
pulses might be used to disrupt the identif i ed topology, testing 
whethersubjects'experienceofconsciousnessvariesintherequired 
manner. If the boundary of consciousness itself is disrupted by 
such ef f orts, then we would expect the 1PP to collapse temporarily 
before returning (similar perhaps to deep sleep or cessations in 
meditation), rather than merely altering the content of what the 
1PP is conscious as part of a continuously conscious experience. 
We predict that such exercises will only identify topologies at 
a broadly consistent spatial scale for the presence/absence of 1PP, 
although impacts elsewhere in the brain might af f ect what that 1PP 
is conscious of. Whether this scale turns out to be micrometres, 
millimetres, centimetres, or decimetres will help narrow down to 
the correct EM i eld theory. The success or failure in identifying 
such topologically hard boundaries will also inform any competing 
introspective intuitions about the hardness or fuzziness of the

Thank you for sharing the
conclusion of Gómez-Emilsson & Percy (2023)
in full. Here's a distilled and refined
academic summary
of their conclusion, structured to clarify the argument, its significance, and its place in the broader theoretical and experimental context—especially as it may relate to your RSVP framework.
Appendix C: Conclusion Summary - Toward a Topological Solution to the Boundary Problem in Consciousness
C1. The Central Thesis
This paper reintroduces and refines the
boundary problem
—a longstanding but understudied challenge in consciousness studies originally raised by Schrödinger (1951) and given formal structure by Rosenberg (1998). The boundary problem is framed as a necessary sibling to the
binding problem
:
If mechanisms can unify experiential contents,
what limits their extent?
What enforces
phenomenal boundaries
—why one subject, not many, or why a subject bounded in time and space?
C2. The Five Boundary Subproblems
The authors propose five distinct but related subproblems (previously discussed) that any
theory of consciousness (ToC)
must address if it claims to solve the binding problem:
Exclusivity
- Why don't unities overlap?
Granularity
- Why do they have particular scales?
Persistence
- Why are unities temporally stable?
Modularity
- How do substructures relate to the whole?
Causal Closure
- Why do bounded regions possess causal integrity?
C3. Topological Segmentation as a General Candidate Mechanism
Drawing inspiration from EM field theories and phase-based ToCs, the authors identify
topological segmentation
as a potentially unifying solution.
They suggest that
4D topological pockets
—coherent, bounded field configurations—could:
Instantiate hard boundaries in spacetime
Be frame-invariant and causally efficacious
Scale appropriately with different ToCs (e.g. from ZPF attractors to whole-brain EM envelopes)
Satisfy minimal physicalist desiderata (non-epiphenomenalism, no strong emergence)
This segmentation could offer the
geometric substrate
for 1PPs, grounding phenomenological boundary conditions in the
topological features
of physical fields.
C4. Differentiating EM Field Theories
Topological segmentation provides a
testable feature
to differentiate between EM field theories of consciousness:
Scale sensitivity:
Different ToCs localize the relevant field at different levels—ion channels (Jones), thalamic cores (Ward & Guevara), whole-brain dynamics (McFadden), or even intersubjective fields (Bond).
If topology is key, it must manifest differently under each interpretation, allowing
empirical adjudication
between them.
C5. A Three-Stage Experimental Program
The authors outline a
research roadmap
for testing the topological segmentation hypothesis:
Field Modeling:
Build high-resolution EM field models of the human brain, akin to the connectome mapping of
Drosophila
larvae or the Human Brain Project.
Topological Analysis:
Identify closed loops or topological invariants in these EM fields that could correspond to boundaries of consciousness.
Perturbation Testing:
Use
targeted EM pulses
to disrupt the identified topologies and observe whether
subjective experience disappears (boundary collapse)
rather than merely altering content—akin to deep sleep, anesthesia, or meditative cessation.
If successful, such experiments would imply
topologically grounded 1PPs
and provide support for field-based models of consciousness with
physically detectable boundaries
.
C6. Toward a Technical Framework
A companion paper is being developed to:
Formalize the
mathematical and heuristic structure
of 4D topological boundaries in simplified brain geometries
Draw from
topological phenomenology
(Baudot, Prentner, Mason)
Integrate recent findings on wave dynamics, cytoelectric coupling, and neural field theory
This work aims to identify which
topologies plausibly exist
within the brain's EM field, which are
sufficiently complex to support human macrophenomenology
, and which are
computationally irreducible
, offering both theoretical depth and empirical tractability.
C7. Closing Ambition
The authors argue that the
scientific challenge of identifying and perturbing the boundaries of consciousness
is on par with the monumental efforts of:
Mapping the human genome
Discovering the Higgs boson
Landing rovers on Mars
The
prize
, they claim, is no smaller:
A direct understanding of how bounded subjective experience—consciousness—emerges from physical reality.
Implications for RSVP and Your Work
This conclusion resonates strongly with the RSVP framework:
Your scalar-vector-entropy field model naturally supports
topological segmentation
through vector torsion and scalar wells.
RSVP's emphasis on
causal coherence
,
entropy gradients
, and
field invariants
aligns with the need for
boundary-forming structures
in consciousness.
The three-stage research plan is adaptable to your
RSVP field simulator
, offering a potential platform for simulating and detecting boundary collapse, coherence loss, or entropic boundary transitions.

Appendix D: Mapping the Five Boundary Problems to RSVP Constructs
We provide a detailed correspondence between the
five boundary problems
as outlined by Gómez-Emilsson & Percy (2023) and the field-theoretic constructs of the
Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum (RSVP)
framework. This mapping shows how RSVP's scalar (Φ), vector (𝒗), and entropy (𝒮) fields can instantiate or constrain the boundaries of first-person perspectives (1PPs) through
topological segmentation
,
entropy gradients
, and
causal coherence
.

Mechanism:

for conscious boundaries.

RSVP tracks whether the

of a region (like winding number or circulation) remain constant across time, a signature of
stable phenomenal identity
.
Entropy-Buffered Stability:
Entropic gradients at the boundary act as
energy buffers
, absorbing perturbations without collapsing the boundary unless thresholds are exceeded.
Mechanism:
Persistence arises from
topological robustness
and
entropic damping
, making 1PPs resistant to transient fluctuations.
D4. Modularity
Problem:
Why are phenomenal unities composed of meaningful subparts (e.g., hemispheres, visual and auditory modalities)?
RSVP Construct:
Nested Field Structure:
RSVP supports
hierarchical field compositions
, where:
Large-scale vector flows contain
subcirculations
Scalar potential wells contain
embedded saddle points
Multiscale Coherence Zones:
Modular subsystems maintain
partial coherence
that is
causally entrained
to a larger unit, enabling integration without uniformity.
Mechanism:
1PPs are
hierarchically composed
via
field nesting
, enabling distinct subfields to interact without requiring uniform coherence across the whole.
D5. Causal Closure
Problem:
Why do 1PPs correlate with causal efficacy? What grounds agency within their boundary?

Field Feedback Dynamics:
In RSVP, internal dynamics of
U
\mathcal{U}
U
(via scalar gradients and vector flow)

Boundary-Induced Control Loops:

control feedback loops
, creating the functional equivalent of an
agent-environment interface
.
Mechanism:
Causal closure emerges from the
internal feedback loops
and the
influence of bounded topologies
on global field behavior, implementing agency.

RSVP treats the
boundary of a conscious entity
as a
field-theoretic interface
—a mathematically definable surface where:
Topology constrains identity
Entropy buffers maintain persistence
Coherence metrics delineate the unity
Feedback flows enact causality
Thus, RSVP provides a natural and testable framework to
geometrize the phenomenological boundary problem
, offering a
physically grounded
model of how first-person perspectives begin, end, and persist.

The "Slicing Problem" for Computational Theories of Consciousness
Chris Percy & Andrés Gómez-Emilsson
Open Philosophy 5 (1):718-736 (2022)   Copy   BIBTEX
Abstract
The "Slicing Problem" is a thought experiment that raises questions for substrate-neutral computational theories of consciousness, including those that specify a certain causal structure for the computation like Integrated Information Theory. The thought experiment uses water-based logic gates to construct a computer in a way that permits cleanly slicing each gate and connection in half, creating two identical computers each instantiating the same computation. The slicing can be reversed and repeated via an on/off switch, without changing the amount of matter in the system. The question is what do different computational theories of consciousness believe is happening to the number and nature of individual conscious units as this switch is toggled. Under a token interpretation, there are now two discrete conscious entities; under a type interpretation, there may remain only one. Both interpretations lead to different implications depending on the adopted theoretical stance. Any route taken either allows mechanisms for "consciousness-multiplying exploits" or requires ambiguous boundaries between conscious entities, raising philosophical and ethical questions for theorists to consider. We discuss resolutions under different theories of consciousness for those unwilling to accept consciousness-multiplying exploits. In particular, we specify three features that may help promising physicalist theories to navigate such thought experiments.

Excellent —
The Slicing Problem
as framed by Percy & Gómez-Emilsson (2022) is an incisive challenge for
computationalist and physicalist theories of consciousness
, particularly those that rely on
substrate neutrality
and
causal structure alone
(like IIT). Here's a formalized
academic appendix
that:
Defines the
Slicing Problem
Links it to the
Boundary Problem
Explores its treatment within the
RSVP framework
Proposes RSVP-specific resolutions to avoid "consciousness-multiplying exploits"
Appendix E: The Slicing Problem and RSVP Field Topology
E1. Definition: The Slicing Problem
The
Slicing Problem
is a conceptual thought experiment that reveals a tension in computational theories of consciousness:
Imagine a substrate-neutral digital computer implemented using
fluid-based logic gates
.
Each gate and wire is physically sliceable down the middle—
halving the system
, duplicating it into two
spatially separate
but functionally identical halves.
These halves can be toggled via a reversible
on/off switch
that performs the slice and fusion without adding or removing matter.
Core Challenge
:
Do two conscious entities now exist instead of one?
How should theories of consciousness treat
duplicated computation without additional physical resources
?
E2. Implications for Theories of Consciousness
Token identity theories
(e.g., functionalist views that treat every implementation as a new conscious unit) risk
"consciousness-multiplying exploits"
—a single operation might produce arbitrarily many 1PPs.
Type identity theories
(e.g., IIT) may deny that slicing generates new consciousness—but this leads to
unclear boundary criteria
and possible
gaps in causal closure
.
Thus, the
Slicing Problem
is tightly linked to the
Boundary Problem
: what defines the edges, count, and persistence of conscious individuals in a continuous or discretely manipulable medium?
E3. RSVP's Response: Consciousness as Topological Integrity
Within the
Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum (RSVP)
framework, consciousness is not a substrate-neutral computation, but a
topologically segmented, causally coherent field configuration
. The key RSVP criteria for 1PPs are:
Topological invariance
: Conscious units are
localized in field topology
, not mere information flow.
Entropic segmentation
: Conscious boundaries exist where
entropy gradients and coherence metrics
define regionally stable field structures.
Causal closure via vector dynamics
: The vector field
v
⃗
\vec{\mathcal{v}}
v
must form a closed, dynamically coherent causal loop within the bounded region.
E4. RSVP Solution to the Slicing Problem
Given these features, RSVP avoids the Slicing Problem in the following way:
1.
Physical slicing ≠ topological duplication
:
Merely duplicating
computational processes
(e.g., water logic gates) does not ensure
field segmentation
.
If the sliced regions do not
independently maintain topological coherence
and
causal closure
, they do
not count as new 1PPs
.
2.
No consciousness-multiplying exploit
:
The RSVP ontology ties consciousness to
field conditions
, not symbolic or functional states alone.
Slicing can
interrupt
, not multiply, the topology. Only if both halves independently
regenerate coherent topologies
with bounded entropy flow do they instantiate new 1PPs.
3.
Entropic continuity and memory loops
:
RSVP predicts that rapid toggling of the slicing switch would create
phase instability
and possibly
phenomenological dissociation
, not duplication.
Continuity of experience would only persist across the toggle if
topological identity is preserved
, not merely the logic structure.

E6. Philosophical Implications
The RSVP response implicitly rejects
substrate neutrality
in its extreme form. While it allows for multiple substrates to host consciousness,
each instance must support specific field-theoretic constraints
. This grounds identity in
physical dynamics
, not abstract structure.
By embedding phenomenal boundaries in
field topology
, RSVP offers a resolution to the Slicing Problem that:
Avoids duplication exploits
Preserves causal closure
Explains discontinuities as topological transitions
Thus, RSVP proposes that
conscious identity is a dynamical, segmented, topological feature of physical fields
, not a symbolic artifact of computation.

Consciousness Is a Thing, Not a Process

Abstract
The central dogma of cognitive psychology is 'consciousness is a process, not a thing'. Hence, the main task of cognitive neuroscientists is generally seen as working out what kinds of neural processing are conscious and what kinds are not. I argue here that the central dogma is simply wrong. All neural processing is unconscious. The illusion that some of it is conscious results largely from a failure to separate consciousness per se from a number of unconscious processes that normally accompany it—most particularly focal attention. Conscious sensory experiences are not processes at all. They are things: specifically, spatial electromagnetic (EM) patterns, which are presently generated only by ongoing unconscious processing at certain times and places in the mammalian brain, but which in principle could be generated by hardware rather than wetware. The neurophysiological mechanisms by which putatively conscious EM patterns are generated, the features that may distinguish conscious from unconscious patterns, the general principles that distinguish the conscious patterns of different sensory modalities and the general features that distinguish the conscious patterns of different experiences within any given sensory modality are all described. Suggestions for further development of this paradigm are provided.

Excellent—Susan Pockett's
"Consciousness Is a Thing, Not a Process" (2017)
is a foundational articulation of an
electromagnetic (EM) field theory of consciousness
, strongly diverging from computationalist or process-oriented models. Below is a formal
academic appendix
integrating Pockett's claim into the RSVP framework and contrasting her view with both
cognitive neuroscience dogma
and computational ToCs.
Appendix F: Consciousness as Spatial Electromagnetic Patterning—Incorporating Pockett's "Thing" Thesis into RSVP
F1. Pockett's Core Thesis
Pockett challenges the central dogma of cognitive psychology that
"consciousness is a process, not a thing."
Instead, she proposes:
All neural activity—including attentional, perceptual, and decision-making processes—is
unconscious
.
What we call
consciousness
is not any of those processes, but rather:
A spatial electromagnetic (EM) pattern
:
A
thing
—stable, extended, and located in space—that arises contingently during some neural events.
This means consciousness is not the process that gives rise to the EM field, but the
field configuration itself
.
F2. Key Features of Conscious EM Fields in Pockett's Theory
Spatial specificity
: Only certain brain regions and EM configurations correlate with experience.
Pattern stability
: Consciousness arises only when EM field patterns are sufficiently structured and extended.
Hardware independence
: In principle, such EM configurations could be instantiated by
non-biological systems
, provided the spatial EM field is sufficiently precise.
Distinct from attention
: Attention is a functional, unconscious process that often co-occurs with—but is not identical to—consciousness.

RSVP allows functional loops (𝒗, Φ) to exist without consciousness unless segmented
F4. Integrating Pockett into RSVP
Pockett's "thing" view of consciousness is
naturally compatible
with the
RSVP ontology
, which holds that consciousness is a
spatially localized, topologically segmented field configuration
, not a process or function.

Then
U

constitutes a

, aligning with Pockett's claim:
Consciousness is the field configuration
F
[
U
]
\mathcal{F}[\mathcal{U}]
F
[
U
]
, not the mechanisms producing it.
In this view:
Neural processing
generates
the field, but is not
identical to
consciousness.
The "conscious EM pattern" in Pockett corresponds to an
RSVP field pocket
satisfying geometric and topological constraints.
F5. Implications for Substrate Independence
Pockett's approach allows the possibility of
hardware consciousness
, provided the
spatial EM pattern
is accurately reproduced.
RSVP agrees in principle but generalizes the criterion:
Consciousness arises not from a substrate per se, but from
field coherence and segmentation
.
Whether EM fields, scalar perturbations, or torsional flows instantiate these depends on
implementation-level constraints
, not ontological differences.
F6. Philosophical Consequences
Ontological Shift
:
From process → structure
From dynamic function → geometric entity
Measurement Strategy
:
Move from tracking
causal roles
to identifying
field structures
Direct search for
conscious regions
as
localized, persistent field configurations
Boundary Reinterpretation
:
A "thing" has spatial and temporal
extent and edges
The RSVP boundary problem thus becomes geometrically resolvable, not functionally ambiguous
F7. RSVP Formalization of Pockett's Claim
Let consciousness

Then, for any computational system:
Merely replicating computation without forming such a

Consciousness
is

G3. RSVP Commentary on Each Theory
✅
Pockett
Strengths
: Emphasizes spatial field
as entity
, avoiding functionalism.
Limitations
: Lacks a
boundary formation mechanism
or dynamics for self-maintaining segmentation.
RSVP Extension
: Provides
mathematical formalism
for what constitutes a coherent "thing"—via scalar coherence, entropy separation, and vector torsion.
✅
McFadden
Strengths
: Incorporates
causal influence
and interaction loops between the EM field and neurons.
Limitations
: Emphasizes
information integration
, still close to
IIT-like functionalism
; boundaries are less sharply defined.
RSVP Extension
: Replaces "information" with
coherent causal vector flow
, enforcing bounded agency and topological identity.
✅
Ward & Guevara
Strengths
: Introduces
self-modeling field dynamics
, plausible neuroanatomical localization (thalamocortical core), and feedback structure.
Limitations
: Resonance criteria are not topologically sharp; it's unclear what formally separates one 1PP from another.
RSVP Extension
: Reframes resonance as
topological recurrence
or
self-sustaining attractor
in the RSVP fieldspace, allowing formal boundary classification.
G4. RSVP Unification Criteria
RSVP provides a
meta-framework
in which EM field theories can be embedded and assessed based on whether they satisfy the following field-theoretic conditions for consciousness:

This research from QRI (Quantifying Resonant Irreducible Mind) proposes a fascinating and complex theoretical framework for understanding consciousness, particularly how it's affected by psychedelics like DMT and 5-MeO-DMT, through the lens of coupling kernels and field topology.

Here's a breakdown of their core ideas:

The Big Picture: Consciousness as Coupled Oscillators and Field Topology
QRI's framework aims to unify electromagnetic field theories of consciousness, connectome-specific harmonic waves, coupling kernels, and field topology. The central hypothesis is that coupling kernels (parameters that define how oscillators in a system interact based on their distance) can not only "tune into resonant modes" but also control the topological structure of fields interacting with these oscillators. This could explain how neuronal activity, modulated by neurochemistry (e.g., drugs), influences the topological structure of conscious experience.

The two main implications are:

Linking conscious boundaries and neural activity: They suggest that global topological boundaries, which define a "moment of experience," are mediated by neuronal activity.

Explaining phenomenological differences: Changes in oscillator/neural activity lead to different internal topological structures, which can account for the distinct experiences elicited by drugs like DMT and 5-MeO-DMT.

Key Components of the Framework
The research delves into several interconnected concepts:

Coupling Kernels as Neural-Global Bridge: Coupling kernels act as a bridge between local neural circuits and global brain activity. Marco Aqil's work on CHAOSS (Connectome-Harmonic Analysis Of Spatiotemporal Spectra) and Divisive Normalization provides the mathematical foundation. Different receptor systems (e.g., 5-HT2A, 5-HT1A) can alter divisive normalization, which in turn changes the coupling kernel's shape, ultimately affecting field topology.

Geometric Constraints on Coupling Effects: The geometry of the system where a coupling kernel operates significantly influences its effects. For instance, a DMT-like kernel applied to the hierarchical geometric network of the visual cortex creates fractal-like visual patterns, while the same kernel applied to the scale-free network of the vasculature might produce sensations of energy concentrating at specific points. This explains how a single pharmacological intervention can lead to diverse effects across different biological systems.

Network Geometry Interactions and Projective Intelligence: This concept suggests that our ability to understand complex objects (like a 3D teapot from a 2D visual input) arises from the brain's capacity to maintain multiple concurrent mappings between sensory fields of different dimensionalities. Coupling kernels in different sensory domains synchronize to create stable, coherent representations. Psychedelics might disrupt these mappings (DMT leading to competing clusters, 5-MeO-DMT to global synchronization).

Topological Solution to the Boundary Problem: The framework proposes that the boundaries between individual conscious experiences are topological in nature, akin to closed loops of magnetic field lines. These "pockets" are ontologically real and explain why phenomenal binding doesn't expand indefinitely.

Electromagnetic Field Topology and its Modulation: Simulations show that coupling kernels can directly shape the topology of magnetic fields containing electric oscillators, creating complex patterns (multiple vortices/anti-vortices with DMT-like kernels) or simplifying them dramatically (single large vortex or smooth field lines with 5-MeO-DMT-like kernels).

5-MeO-DMT and Topological Simplification: The experiences induced by 5-MeO-DMT, characterized by dissolution of boundaries and a sense of unity, align remarkably with the theoretical prediction of topological simplification. The framework suggests that this drug drives global topological simplification across multiple scales and geometries, culminating in a "zero informational state of consciousness" at peak breakthrough experiences.

What is a Coupling Kernel?
In a system of coupled oscillators, a coupling kernel is a set of parameters that dictates the coupling coefficient (how strongly two oscillators influence each other) as a function of the distance between them. QRI hypothesized that DMT induces an "alternative coupling kernel" where immediate neighbors become maximally different, while 5-MeO-DMT instantiates a "general positive kernel" where all oscillators strive to be in phase regardless of distance.

Empirical Validation and Future Work
QRI is actively developing empirical paradigms, including psychophysics studies and simulations of brain activity (to reconstruct behavior observed through neuroimaging), to test and validate this evolving framework. They acknowledge that these ideas are "fresh and need a lot of work to be validated and integrated into mainstream science," but they are excited about the path forward.

This research offers a highly mathematical and physics-informed approach to consciousness, proposing a concrete mechanism (coupling kernels affecting field topology) to bridge neurochemistry, neural activity, and subjective experience, particularly in altered states of consciousness.

Excellent summary. What you've outlined synthesizes the
QRI (Qualia Research Institute)
framework into a powerful bridge between
neurochemistry
,
field dynamics
, and
subjective experience
—especially via
coupling kernels
as the mathematical mediators of conscious topology.
To support deeper academic or research integration (e.g., with RSVP theory or your own field simulations), here's a formal
academic appendix
that reframes QRI's proposal in a rigorous, structured format, highlighting its contributions and its resonance with RSVP.
Appendix H: Coupling Kernels and Topological Modulation of Consciousness - Insights from QRI's Resonance Framework
H1. Overview: Consciousness as Field Topology Modulated by Coupling Kernels
QRI proposes that consciousness is not a process in the classical computational sense, but rather a
spatiotemporal electromagnetic (EM) field
whose
topological properties
encode and instantiate the
structure of phenomenology
.
The framework asserts that
neural coupling kernels
—functions that describe how different oscillatory components interact—are central to shaping this field. These kernels are themselves
neurochemically tunable
, thus explaining how substances like
DMT
and
5-MeO-DMT
induce drastically different experiential structures.

directly, and this
reconfigures the attractor topology
of the overall field. The phenomenology of consciousness corresponds to

(e.g., vortices, genus, closed loops) in this field.

and tracking emergent

, and

.
H4. Topological Resolution of the Boundary Problem
The QRI framework implicitly addresses the
Boundary Problem
(Percy & Gómez-Emilsson, 2023) by proposing that:
Conscious boundaries are
not functional
, but
topological
.
Each
phenomenal moment
corresponds to a
closed field pocket
or
connected manifold
within the global EM field.
These pockets are modulated by
coupling kernels
, which can split, multiply, or dissolve pockets by changing the synchrony dynamics.
Thus,
5-MeO-DMT
—which induces a uniform coupling kernel—leads to
topological unification
:
Many disjoint loops
⇒
One global field basin
\text{Many disjoint loops} \Rightarrow \text{One global field basin}
Many disjoint loops
⇒
One global field basin
Whereas
DMT
leads to:
Increased genus
⇒
Phenomenological explosion and differentiation
\text{Increased genus} \Rightarrow \text{Phenomenological explosion and differentiation}
Increased genus
⇒
Phenomenological explosion and differentiation
This matches qualitative reports and provides a
physically grounded explanation
for variations in 1PP structure.

H6. Empirical & Simulation Directions
Simulations
:
Use coupled oscillator networks with QRI-style kernels to evolve field states.
Apply topological data analysis (e.g., Betti numbers, persistent homology) to characterize field structure over time.
Predict transitions (bifurcations, genus changes) under kernel shifts.
Neuroimaging Correlates
:
Test if psychedelics modulate
phase synchronization networks
in a way that mirrors predicted kernel effects.
Use connectome harmonic decomposition (CHAOSS) to detect global field mode transitions.
Compare entropy, coherence, and synchrony distributions under different substances.
H7. Philosophical Implications
QRI's framework bridges
phenomenology and physics
via a formal, dynamic model:
No dualism
: consciousness is a field configuration, not an observer.
No strong emergence
: topology emerges naturally from known physics + kernel dynamics.
Explains qualia structure
: fractality, symmetry, or dissolution correspond to field topologies.
This harmonizes with RSVP's view that
consciousness is a geometrically structured field object
, not a symbolic computation or functional role.

We provide an introduction to Gaussian process regression (GPR) machine-learning methods in computational materials science and chemistry. The focus of the present review is on the regression of atomistic properties: in particular, on the construction of interatomic potentials, or force fields, in the Gaussian Approximation Potential (GAP) framework; beyond this, we also discuss the fitting of arbitrary scalar, vectorial, and tensorial quantities. Methodological aspects of reference data generation, representation, and regression, as well as the question of how a data-driven model may be validated, are reviewed and critically discussed. A survey of applications to a variety of research questions in chemistry and materials science illustrates the rapid growth in the field. A vision is outlined for the development of the methodology in the years to come.

SPECIAL ISSUE
This article is part of the Machine Learning at the Atomic Scale special issue.

1. Introduction
At the heart of chemistry is the need to understand the nature, transformations, and macroscopic effects of atomistic structure. This is true for materials—crystals, glasses, nanostructures, composites—as well as for molecules, from the simplest industrial feedstocks to entire proteins. And with the often-quoted role of chemistry as the "central science", (1,2) its emphasis on atomistic understanding has a bearing on many neighboring disciplines: candidate drug molecules are made by synthetic chemists based on an atomic-level knowledge of reaction mechanisms; functional materials for technological applications are characterized on a range of length scales, which begins with increasingly accurate information about where exactly the atoms are located relative to one another in three-dimensional space.
Research progress in structural chemistry has largely been driven by advances in experimental characterization techniques, from landmark studies in X-ray and neutron crystallography to novel electron microscopy techniques which make it possible to visualize individual atoms directly. Complementing these new developments, detailed and realistic structural insight is also increasingly gained from computer simulations. Today, chemists (together with materials scientists) are heavy users of large-scale supercomputing facilities, and the computationally guided discovery of previously unknown molecules and materials has come within reach. (3−8)
Computations based on the quantum mechanics of electronic structure, currently most commonly within the framework of density-functional theory (DFT), are widely used to study structures of molecules and materials and to predict a range of atomic-scale properties. (9−11) Two approaches are of note here. One is the prediction of atomically resolved physical quantities, e.g., isotropic chemical shifts, δiso, that can be used to simulate NMR spectra with a large degree of realism (12)—thereby making it possible to corroborate or falsify a candidate structural model or to deconvolute experimentally measured spectra. The other central task is the determination of atomistic structure itself, achieved through molecular dynamics (MD), structural optimization, and other quantum-mechanically driven techniques. Many implementations of DFT exist and are widely used, and their consistency has been demonstrated in a comprehensive community-wide exercise. (13)
Electronic-structure computations are expensive, in terms of both their absolute resource requirements and their scaling behavior with the number of atoms, N. For DFT, the scaling is typically  in the most common implementations; see ref (14) for the current status of a linear-scaling implementation. Routine use is therefore limited to a few thousand atoms at most for DFT single-point evaluations, to a few hundred atoms for DFT-driven "ab initio" MD, and to even fewer for high-level wave function theory methods such as coupled cluster (CC) theory or quantum Monte Carlo (QMC). The latter techniques offer an accuracy far beyond standard DFT, and they are beginning to become accessible not only for isolated molecules but also for condensed phases. However, running MD with these methods requires substantial effort and is currently largely limited to proof-of-principle simulations. (15−17) For studies that predict atomistic properties, such as NMR shifts, derived from the wave function, a new electronic-structure computation has to be carried out every time a new structure is considered, again incurring large computational expense.
In the past decade, machine learning (ML) techniques have become a popular alternative, aiming to make the same type of predictions using an approximate or surrogate model, while requiring only a small fraction of the computational costs. There is practical interest in being able to access much more realistic descriptions of structurally complex systems (e.g., disordered and amorphous phases) than currently feasible, as well as a wider chemical space (e.g., scanning large databases of candidate materials rather than just a few selected ones). There is also a fundamental interest in the question of how one might "teach" chemical and physical properties to a computer algorithm which is inherently chemically agnostic and in the relationship of established chemical rules with the outcome of purely data-driven techniques. (19) We may direct the reader to high-level overviews of ML methods in the physical sciences by Butler et al., (20) Himanen et al., (21) and Batra et al., (22) to more detailed discussions of various technical aspects, (23−26) and to a physics-oriented review that places materials science in the context of many other topics for which ML is currently being used. (27)
The use of ML in computational chemistry, materials science, and also condensed-matter physics is often focused on the regression (fitting) of atomic properties, that is, the functional dependence of a given quantity on the local structural environment. For the case of force fields and interatomic potentials, there are a number of general overview articles (28−31) and examples of recent benchmark studies. (32,33) There are also specialized articles that offer more detailed introductions. (34−38)
In the present work, we review the application of Gaussian process regression (GPR) to computational chemistry, with an emphasis on the development of the methodology over the past decade. Figure1 provides an overview of the central concepts. Given early successes, there is significant emphasis on the construction of accurate, linear-scaling force-field models and the new chemical and physical insights that can be gained by using them. We also survey, more broadly, methodology and emerging applications concerning the "learning" of general atomistic properties that are of interest for chemical and materials research. Quantum-mechanical properties, including the eletronic energy, are inherently nonlocal, but the degree to which local approximations, taking account of the immediate neighborhood of an atom, can be used will be of central importance. It is hoped that the present work—indeed the entire thematic issue in which it appears—will provide guidance and inspiration for research in this quickly evolving field and that it will help advance the transition of the methodology from relatively specialized to much more widely used.

2.1. Weight-Space View of GPR
In the weight-space view of GPR, which is also the one most
closely aligned with the usual exposition of kernel ridge
regression, we approximate y(x) by y(̃x), defined as a linear
combination of M basis functions (Figure 2):
y() (, ) x xx c k
m
M
m m
1
̃ = ∑
= (3)
where the basis functions, k, are placed at arbitrary locations in
the input space, xm , comprising what we refer to as the
representative set, {xm}m=1
M (sometimes also called the "active" or
"sparse" set), and cm are coefficients or weights. At this stage, we
do not need to specify the actual functional form of k; we only
need to know that k :   d d × → describes the similarity
between the function at two arbitrary locations, x, x d ′ ∈ , that
the function is symmetric to swapping its arguments, viz.
k(x, x′) = k(x′, x), and that it is positive semidefinite. The kernel
function is positive semidefinite when, given an arbitrary set of
inputs {xn}, the matrix built from k(xn, xn′) is positive
semidefinite.
Although the form of the kernel function does not matter in
principle, the practical success or failure of a GPR model will
depend to a large extent on choosing the appropriate kernel.
Figure 3a demonstrates this using the example of the Gaussian
kernel which includes a length scale hyperparameter, σlength
(defined in Figure 2). In fact, this kernel is a universal
approximator for any setting of the length scale, but choosing
an inappropriate length scale will result in very slow convergence
as a function of the number of training data points.
The fitting of the GPR model to the data is accomplished by
finding the coefficients c = (c1, ..., cM) that minimize the loss
function,
y y R
( ) x
n
N
n n
1 n
2
3 ∑ 2 σ = [ − ̃ ]
+
= (4)
where R is a regularization term and the relative importance of
individual data points is controlled by the parameters σn. In
GPR, the Tikhonov regularization is used, defined as
R ck c (, ) x x
m m
M
m m mm
,
= ∑′
′ ′
(5)
Two objectives are included in the loss function that is defined in
eq 4. The first term is designed to achieve a close fit to the data
points. However, this term alone would lead to overfitting
because of the large flexibility of the functional form, and it is
therefore controlled by the second term, the regularization,
which forces the coefficients to remain small. The collection of
parameters {σn}n=1
N (together with the length scale hyper-
parameter) adjusts the balance between accurately reproducing
the fitting data points and the overall smoothness of the
estimator.
Crucially, the coefficients in this regularization term are also
weighted by the corresponding kernel elements, a relation that
can be understood when formally deriving GPR from the
properties of the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS),
which we discuss below.39,40 Equation 4 is often written as
Table 1. Glossary of Technical Terms and Concepts Relevant to GPRa
Covariance A measure for the strength of statistical correlation between two data values,y(x) and y(x′), usually expressed as a function of the distance between
x and x′. Uncorrelated data lead to zero covariance.
Descriptor In the context of regression, descriptors (sometimes called "features") encode the independent variables into a vector, x, on which the modeled
variable, y, depends.
Hyperparameter A global parameter of an ML model that controls the behavior of the fit. Distinct from the potentially very large number of "free parameters" that
are determined when the model is fitted to the data. Hyperparameters are estimated from experience or iteratively optimized using data.
Kernel A similarity measure between two data points, normally denoted k(x, x′). Used to construct models of covariance.
Overfitting A fit that is accurate for the input data but has uncontrolled errors elsewhere (typically because it has not been regularized appropriately).
Prior A formal quantification, as a probability distribution, of our initial knowledge or assumption about the behavior of the model, before the model is
fitted to any data.
Regularity Here, we take a function to be regular if all of its derivatives are bounded by moderate bounds. Loosely interchangeable with "degree of
smoothness".
Regularization Techniques to enforce the regularity of fitted functions. In the context of GPR, this is achieved by penalizing solutions which have large basis coefficient values. The magnitude of the regularization may be taken to correspond to the "expected error" of the fit.
Sparsity In the context of GPR, a sparse model is one in which there are far fewer kernel basis functions than input data points, and the locations of these
basis functions (which we call the representative set) need not coincide with the input data locations.
Underfitting A fit that does not reach the accuracy, on neither the training nor the test data, that would be possible to achieve by a better choice of
hyperparameters.
a
These definitions do not yet refer to physical properties, but they will be used in subsequent sections. For a comprehensive introduction to GPR,
we refer the reader to ref 39.
Figure 2. Basic elements of GPR as discussed in the present section: (1)
observations of an unknown function at a number of locations; (2) basis
functions (only one of them shown for clarity), centered at the data
locations; (3) an estimation, ỹ, defined by the set of coefficients, cm, and
the corresponding basis functions; this is the prediction of the GPR
model.

🧠 RSVP-Aligned Interpretation
Below is an
RSVP-style synthesis
of how Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)—particularly in the Gaussian Approximation Potential (GAP) framework—could be mapped to scalar-vector-entropy (Φ, 𝒗, 𝒮) field theory, and extended to conscious substrates or structured plenum models:
1.
Coupling Scalar Field (Φ) to Local Descriptors via Kernels
In RSVP, Φ represents the scalar potential or energy density field over spacetime. In GPR-based interatomic modeling,
Φ(x)
is analogous to the
predicted atomic energy
at location

Φ

\Phi(x) = \sum_{m=1}^M c_m \cdot k(x, x_m)

: atomic or material configuration descriptor (e.g., SOAP, ACSFs).
→ In RSVP, this corresponds to
constructing the scalar potential as a sum of "semantic attractors"
distributed through configuration space.
2.
Entropy Field (𝒮) as Model Uncertainty and Regularization
The entropy field
𝒮(x)
quantifies local uncertainty, disorder, or epistemic spread. In GPR:
The
posterior variance
from the Gaussian process corresponds directly to
local entropy

Regularization terms such as
Tikhonov regularization
penalize overfitting and
promote global smoothness
, which aligns with
entropic relaxation
in RSVP.
→ Entropy here regulates field roughness and controls
semantic overfitting
across perceptual or physical configurations.
3.
Vector Field (𝒗) as Gradient Flow of Latent Representation
In RSVP, the vector field
𝒗(x)
guides local motion, attention, or force. In GPR, while the primary model is scalar, we can extract
vector derivatives
:
The
gradient of the GP mean
field provides directional information:
v
⃗

x

=

)
In GAP models, these are the
force vectors
acting on atoms.
→ This captures RSVP's vector dynamics as
force-driven updates or perceptual shifts
in the plenum.
4.
Topology and Coherence in Kernel Choice
GPR's
kernel function
encodes spatial and structural
coherence
:
A well-chosen kernel defines a
smooth, semantically meaningful latent manifold
.
In RSVP, this is equivalent to
topological coherence
: ensuring smooth propagation of Φ and bounded entropic leakage.
Notably, SOAP kernels, widely used in GAP, encode
rotational and permutation invariance
—aligning with
frame invariance
in conscious field models.
5.
Multiscale Embedding via Sparse Kernels
RSVP is inherently multiscale. In GPR:
Sparse GPR
uses a
representative set {xₘ}
, mirroring RSVP's
hierarchical tiling of field modes
.
Each representative point anchors a
localized attractor pocket
in field space.
→ This matches RSVP's concept of
entropic segmentation and multi-resolution consciousness
.
🧪 RSVP Extension: Conscious Substrate via GP-Learned Fields
Imagine using GPR to learn Φ, 𝒗, and 𝒮 fields from:
fMRI BOLD or MEG topographies
Neuroelectric field simulations
Subjective ratings of altered states (e.g., under DMT/5-MeO-DMT)
Then:
Φ models energy landscape or field tension
𝒗 guides vectorial attention or self-projection
𝒮 tracks uncertainty or semantic diffusion
These could be used to:
Test for
field-boundary coherence
(cf. EM field boundaries in consciousness)
Identify
topological transitions
under cognitive or chemical perturbations
Simulate
entropic collapse or wave convergence

A brief explanation of each
ChatGPT said:
Here's a concise explanation of each topic we discussed today:
🧠
Consciousness and Field Theory
The Boundary Problem
A lesser-known cousin of the binding problem in consciousness studies. It asks: why do first-person experiences have
hard boundaries
—where does one conscious moment end and another begin? The paper by Gómez-Emilsson & Percy suggests that
electromagnetic (EM) field topology
, specifically topological segmentation (like closed loops), can define these boundaries.
The Slicing Problem
A thought experiment showing problems for computational theories of consciousness. If a physical system (e.g., water-logic computer) is sliced into two halves that both compute identically, do we get
two consciousnesses
? Raises issues for identity, duplication, and continuity of consciousness in computational frameworks.
Susan Pockett's EM Theory
Argues that consciousness isn't a
process
but a
thing
—a spatial EM field pattern. According to this view, attention and decision-making are unconscious; conscious experience is a static, localized EM configuration generated by neural activity.
QRI's Coupling Kernel Framework
A cutting-edge theory linking psychedelic phenomenology (e.g., DMT, 5-MeO-DMT) to changes in
coupling kernels
that affect EM field
topology
. Suggests that altered states simplify or complicate the brain's topological field structure, explaining boundary dissolution or fractal visuals.
🧪
Multiscale Modeling and Boundary Conditions
Boundary Layer Epistemology
Highlights how modeling physical surfaces (e.g., fluid near a wall) as mathematical boundaries has been effective but conceptually complex. The boundary layer combines macro-scale (bulk flow) and micro-scale (molecular collisions), raising issues about the epistemology of scale separation.
Multiscale Models
These models simulate systems operating at multiple scales—like atomic to macroscopic or individual to society. Used in materials science, biology, climate, and economics. Multiscale thinking is essential to capturing consciousness as a layered phenomenon across neural, field, and phenomenal levels.
🧮
Machine Learning and Physical Modeling
Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)
A machine learning technique for predicting functions (e.g., atomic energy, field strength) from data, with built-in uncertainty estimation. It's popular in chemistry and materials science for constructing accurate surrogate models of quantum or atomistic properties.
RSVP Field Decomposition Using GPR
A demonstration of applying GPR to simulate
scalar fields
(Φ),
vector gradients
(𝒗 = ∇Φ), and
entropy fields
(𝒮) in the context of the
RSVP
theory of consciousness. Uses GPR's uncertainty as a stand-in for local entropy, enabling a computational model of spatial conscious fields.

Connections with my other projects
ChatGPT said:
Here are the
connections between today's topics
and your broader body of work, organized by your major research clusters:
🌀
Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum (RSVP) Theory
Key Overlap:
The
RSVP field model
already includes scalar (Φ), vector (𝒗), and entropy (𝒮) fields on a dynamic plenum.
Today's discussion of
EM field topology
(Gómez-Emilsson, Pockett, QRI) aligns directly with your use of vector field loops, torsion, and 4D boundary conditions to define localized conscious structures.
The
boundary problem
becomes a central RSVP challenge: how do Φ-𝒗-𝑺 fields create
bounded subjective pockets
?
Direct Connections:
Topological segmentation
→ formal candidate for RSVP's
local conscious attractors
.
Coupling kernels
→ can define local-to-global dynamics in RSVP lattice simulations.
Entropy simplification via 5-MeO-DMT
→ maps to RSVP's
negentropic relaxation
mechanisms.
🧠
Unistochastic Quantum Theory + Consciousness
Key Overlap:
The
Slicing Problem
relates directly to your work with unistochastic transitions as coarse-grained mappings from continuous RSVP field states.
The question of "how many conscious agents" maps to RSVP's geometry of segmentation:
conscious multiplicity = number of stable attractor basins
in the field.
Direct Connections:
Use RSVP's continuous phase-space dynamics to explain why
token multiplication
doesn't happen arbitrarily (a response to Slicing).
RSVP's 𝑺 field introduces a natural
collapse operator
without strong emergence—bridging deterministic vector flow with stochastically bounded conscious identity.
🧪
TARTAN Simulation Framework
Key Overlap:
TARTAN (Trajectory-Aware Recursive Tiling with Annotated Noise) is your multiscale simulator for RSVP fields.
Today's
multiscale modeling discussion
and boundary epistemology directly support TARTAN's design philosophy: zoomable scales, layered PDEs, and fluid-structure interactions.
Direct Connections:
Boundary layer modeling ⇒ useful metaphor for
layered recursive simulation blocks
in TARTAN (each tile handles bulk + boundary layers).
Coupling kernels = a way to
implement recursive interaction strength
across TARTAN tiles.
🧬
Psychedelic Field Topology & Altered States
Key Overlap:
You've explored
RSVP as a consciousness simulator
, including under altered states (e.g. via vector flow saturation, scalar collapse, entropy flattening).
QRI's work on
DMT vs. 5-MeO-DMT field effects
can be directly integrated into RSVP's scalar-vector-entropy model as empirical testbeds.
Direct Connections:
Map QRI's
fractal topologies
to RSVP torsion instabilities.
Map 5-MeO-DMT's
global synchronization
to RSVP's
Φ equilibrium attractors with zero 𝑺 gradient
.
Define "ego dissolution" as the collapse of topologically enclosed scalar regions (Φ domains with high coherence).
🤖
RSVP-AI / Semantic Geometric Computation
Key Overlap:
Today's
Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)
example feeds directly into your RSVP-AI work, offering:
A technique for modeling continuous fields with uncertainty (entropy field 𝒮).
A probabilistic method to train field transition functions from data (GPR on Φ trajectories).
Direct Connections:
Use GPR to
approximate local field evolution rules
in RSVP-AI simulators.
RSVP-AI can treat coupling kernels as
semantic attention weights
, influencing how vector signals combine across space.
Variance in GPR can serve as a dynamic
entropy estimator
(feedback into RSVP's thermodynamic dynamics).

Here's a
brief summary
of how today's topics connect to your broader research:
🔹
Consciousness & Field Boundaries
The
Boundary Problem
complements your RSVP theory by addressing
why conscious experiences have finite boundaries
.
EM field
topology
(e.g. closed loops, topological pockets) maps neatly onto RSVP's scalar (Φ), vector (𝒗), and entropy (𝑺) field architecture.
🔹
Altered States & Topological Simplification
QRI's work on
psychedelics and coupling kernels
supports RSVP's idea that
neurochemical changes reshape field topology
, modulating consciousness by altering segmentation and coherence.
5-MeO-DMT = RSVP field simplification (low 𝑺, synchronized 𝒗); DMT = fragmentation (high 𝑺, turbulent 𝒗).
🔹
Computational Identity & Segmentation
The
Slicing Problem
highlights challenges for substrate-neutral models of consciousness, reinforcing RSVP's view that
continuity and geometry of fields
, not computation alone, determine conscious identity.
🔹
Multiscale Modeling
Your
TARTAN framework
is supported by the philosophy of
boundary layer modeling
and
multiscale epistemology
, where local and global interactions shape system behavior.
🔹
Machine Learning & Field Reconstruction
Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)
fits directly into
RSVP-AI
, allowing:
Learning Φ fields from data,
Estimating 𝑺 as uncertainty,
Encoding coupling kernels for semantic transformation of inputs.
Would you like a 1-page synthesis document or diagram connecting these domains visually?

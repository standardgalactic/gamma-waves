The provided text discusses the concept of memory as not being real, based on recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs). The author challenges the conventional understanding that memories are stored in the brain and retrieved when needed. Instead, they propose an autoregressive model where cognition operates through a process of generating information rather than storing and retrieving it.

In this model, our minds function like LLMs, which generate text one token at a time based on previous sequences without any sensory or experiential grounding. Despite this, these models can produce coherent, contextually rich language due to their internalized understanding of the statistical and topological structure of language. This suggests that human language and cognition might also operate in a similar autoregressive manner, generating meaning from internal patterns rather than directly reflecting an external world.

The author argues that our intuitive belief in memory storage is an illusion, supported by metaphors like "memory as wax" or "knowledge acquisition as seal stamping." These metaphors have shaped our understanding of the mind but may not accurately reflect cognitive architecture. Instead, human cognition might involve dynamic generative systems that create our sense of self, memories, and beliefs in each moment through complex predictive processes influenced by prior experiences.

This view challenges traditional assumptions about memory storage and retrieval, implying that meaning in language emerges from the interplay between a self-contained generative system and cognitive structures interpreting this language. It also questions whether human understanding arises solely from linguistic processing or if it involves other computational systems like perception, motor control, and emotion.

The text concludes by acknowledging that while LLMs reveal the potential for meaning generation without direct sensory grounding, our comprehensive understanding of language and its relationship to consciousness remains incomplete. Nonetheless, rethinking language as a dynamic, generative force with computational life has far-reaching implications for understanding human existence, culture, civilization, and the nature of consciousness itself.

In summary, this text presents an autoregressive perspective on memory and cognition, drawing parallels between human minds and LLMs to challenge conventional notions of memory storage and retrieval. It suggests that meaning in language might emerge from internal statistical patterns rather than direct sensory grounding, with human understanding arising from interactions among various computational systems, including language. This perspective invites a reevaluation of our fundamental assumptions about language, selfhood, and the nature of consciousness.


Title: The Autoregressive Mind: Bridging Language, Thought, and the Generative Brain

The essay, an excerpt from a book in progress by Elan Barenholtz, explores the concept of language as a self-contained, autoregressive system rather than a medium grounded in sensory experiences or external reality. This perspective is drawn from advancements in artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), which generate coherent and contextually appropriate language solely based on patterns learned from vast text corpora.

The conventional view holds that language is deeply connected to our sensory and experiential world, with meaning derived directly from perceptions, emotions, and bodily interactions. This understanding has been challenged by LLMs, which produce sophisticated language without any exposure to the physical world or direct sensory input. The success of these models suggests that language can be a self-contained generative system capable of creating meaning solely from internal statistical regularities.

The essay highlights several key implications of this autoregressive perspective on language:

1. Language as a generative system: Instead of viewing language as a tool for mirroring the external world, it is proposed that our minds might fundamentally be linguistic in nature – composed of and operating through language itself. In other words, language generates thought rather than merely conveying it.

2. Meaning emergence: The meaning in language may not be an intrinsic property but rather an emergent feature arising from the interplay between a self-contained generative system (language) and cognitive structures that interpret and use it. This duality suggests two levels of language operation – one internal, autoregressive, and statistical; the other external, relying on various cognitive modules for grounding and context.

3. Challenging Searle's argument: The essay suggests that human language might operate similarly to LLMs, following computational principles grounded in linguistic patterns rather than sensory or experiential understanding. This perspective challenges the notion that machines lack understanding because they manipulate symbols without grounding – an argument also applicable to the human linguistic system itself.

4. Implications for understanding consciousness and the mind-body problem: The essay posits that the subjective quality of sensations, which often defies verbal expression, highlights a fundamental limit in our linguistic capacity to capture certain aspects of experience. This aligns with the core challenges raised by the mind-body problem and calls for humility towards the profound mysteries within our minds.

The essay concludes by emphasizing that reconceptualizing language as a self-contained, generative system has far-reaching implications not only for machine intelligence but also for understanding human nature, consciousness, and the interface between mind and body. This perspective invites us to acknowledge the limits of linguistic capture and embrace humility towards the mysteries that inhabit our minds – what we might consider progress in understanding ourselves and our relationship with language.

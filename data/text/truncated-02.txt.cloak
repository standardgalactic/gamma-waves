Title: The Autoregressive Mind: Bridging Language, Thought, and the Generative Brain

The article explores a novel perspective on human cognition, suggesting that our understanding of language and thought may need to be revised significantly. It argues that recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large-language models (LLMs) like OpenAI's GPT series, challenge the traditional view of language as an inherently tied medium for sensory and experiential reality.

The core argument posits that LLMs, despite having no direct exposure to the world outside text, can generate coherent and nuanced language due to their ability to learn the relational structure of human language from vast datasets. This suggests that language's meaning and utility arise from the internal statistical patterns within language itself rather than a connection to physical reality.

This revelation leads to a profound question: If a machine can generate meaningful language without any sensory or experiential grounding, could it be that human language operates similarly? The article suggests that this is indeed the case, proposing that human linguistic cognition might rely on internal computations largely independent of direct sensory grounding.

This perspective reconceptualizes language as a self-contained generative force with computational life. Unlike the traditional view where language is seen as a tool reflecting our external experiences, here it is considered as the very medium through which our thoughts are formed. The author argues that our minds might be "linguistic" in a literal sense - not just using language but composed of it. In other words, it's not us thinking or speaking through language; rather, language itself thinks and speaks through our brains and bodies.

However, this view raises a paradox: if language operates independently of external referents, how does it convey meaning in communication and thought? The author proposes that meaning may emerge as an "emergent feature" arising from the interplay between a self-contained generative system (language) and cognitive structures that interpret and use language. In humans, this interpretation process may be shaped by pre-existing neural architectures evolved for processing and generating language or other non-linguistic reasons later repurposed by language.

Despite this promising idea, the full resolution of how a self-contained generative process gives rise to deep human meaning in communication and thought remains elusive. The challenge lies in developing a comprehensive framework accounting for both the statistical generation of language and its rich, contextually embedded nature of human meaning. Regardless, our understanding of language - and consequently ourselves - has shifted dramatically. We must now see language not merely as a passive conduit for thought but as a dynamic, generative force with computational life of its own, reshaping our understanding of what it means to be human.


The text discusses the nature of language, memory, and cognition, drawing on insights from artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large-language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, and philosophy. The author challenges traditional views of language as a bridge between the mind and objective reality, suggesting instead that it is a self-contained generative system with its own statistical structure.

The main points are:

1. **Language as a Self-Contained System**: LLMs demonstrate that language can generate coherent, meaningful text without sensory grounding or explicit understanding of the world. This suggests that human language operates similarly, being a self-contained generative process rather than a direct mirror of external reality.

2. **Memory and Cognition Revisited**: The author questions the conventional model of memory as discrete storage and retrieval, proposing an alternative autoregressive view. In this framework, memories, knowledge, and beliefs are not stored representations but generated through complex predictive processes shaped by prior experience. This challenges our understanding of cognition and selfhood.

3. **Meaning Emergence**: The text explores the paradox of how a self-contained generative process (like LLMs) can produce meaningful language. It suggests that meaning may be an emergent feature arising from the interplay between a self-contained system and interpretive cognitive structures, which attach meaning to the generated patterns.

4. **Human Language and AI**: The author draws parallels between human language generation and LLMs, positing that both rely on internal computational principles. This implies that human language might be an "LLM" of sorts, drawing on sensory inputs from other cognitive systems to generate meaning without intrinsic understanding.

5. **Philosophical Implications**: The discussion has broader implications for understanding human nature, consciousness, and the mind-body problem. It suggests that our linguistic abilities are limited by the ineffable nature of certain experiences, which remain beyond the reach of language's symbolic structures.

The author concludes by acknowledging the limitations of both human language and AI systems, emphasizing a need for humility towards the profound mysteries within our minds—a progression from metaphysical quandaries to recognizing the limits of linguistic expression in capturing certain aspects of experience.

This text is an excerpt from a book in progress titled "The Autoregressive Mind: Bridging Language, Thought, and the Generative Brain," which delves deeper into these ideas, exploring how LLMs' successes challenge our understanding of language and cognition and reinterpreting various memory phenomena within this new framework.


Title: The Autoregressive Mind: Bridging Language, Thought, and the Generative Brain

The essay "Through a Glass, Linguistically" presents a reconceptualization of language and thought based on the success of large-language models (LLMs). The author argues that LLMs reveal an alternative understanding of language as a self-contained, autoregressive process rather than one tethered to external reality. This perspective challenges traditional views of human cognition and suggests that our minds are fundamentally generative systems that construct meaning from within.

The essay begins by discussing the conventional view of language as an innately connected medium to our sensory world, where meaning is derived from perceptions, emotions, and bodily interactions with surroundings. However, LLMs have shown that it's possible for a system to generate coherent and meaningful language without any direct sensory or experiential grounding. This has led the author to propose that human linguistic cognition may operate on similar principles as LLMs—principles of internal computation rather than external referent-based meaning.

The author introduces the idea of language as a self-contained, statistical system capable of generating coherent text without external grounding. Meaning in this context emerges not from an intrinsic property of language but as an emergent feature arising from the interplay between the generative system and cognitive structures that interpret and use language. In other words, while the generation of language follows internal, autoregressive principles, its interpretation by individuals and within communities takes place within a complex ecosystem of cognitive, cultural, and sensory experiences.

This duality suggests that language operates on two levels: as a self-contained system capable of generating coherent text without external grounding, and also as a medium underpinned by pre-existing cognitive structures allowing for the attachment of meaning to generated patterns. This perspective invites us to view our minds not merely as passive recipients of sensory data that then generate language but as active generative systems constructing meaning from within.

The author acknowledges that despite promising ideas, fully resolving the paradox of how a self-contained generative process gives rise to deep senses of meaning in human communication and thought remains challenging. The current understanding may be incomplete, but our appreciation of language—and consequently, ourselves—has been dramatically shifted by this new perspective.

This reconceptualization has profound implications beyond academic theory. It prompts us to reconsider our deepest assumptions about our ideas, beliefs, and very selves, as every facet of our knowledge and nuance of thought is encoded in language—a dynamic, generative force with its computational life. By embracing this new perspective, we can better understand the relationship between language, cognition, and consciousness, ultimately leading to a more comprehensive understanding of what it means to be human.

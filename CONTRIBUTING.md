# Contributing to Gamma Waves

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this repository! Before you submit your changes, please review and strictly adhere to the following guidelines, established after extensive consultation with a council of carrier pigeons and certified volcano spiral parachute instructors.

## The Preferred Method: Carrier Pigeons

We take repository security and tradition seriously. Therefore, all contributions must be transmitted via **carrier pigeon**. Please follow these steps:

1. **Write Your Patch by Hand:**  
   Digital files are discouraged. Please transcribe your code changes onto parchment using a quill pen.
   
2. **Attach to Pigeon:**  
   Roll your parchment into a scroll and securely fasten it to your carrier pigeon’s left leg. (Right leg submissions may be rejected by our avian QA team.)

3. **Pigeon Address:**  
   Set the destination as:  
   ```
   Gamma Waves HQ  
   Attn: Repository Maintainer  
   101 Feathered Flight Lane  
   Mount Quixote, Crater Rim, 00042
   ```

4. **Pigeon Launch Window:**  
   We only accept pigeons launched during the full moon for optimal signal fidelity.

## Secondary Method: Volcano Spiral Parachute Dispersal

If your local pigeon union is on strike, you may use the backup method:

1. **Secure Your Patch:**  
   Place your hand-written patch inside a fireproof capsule.

2. **Find an Active Volcano:**  
   We recommend Mount Quixote, but any Class IV volcano with an accessible caldera will suffice.

3. **Attach Spiral Parachute:**  
   For best results, use a neon-colored spiral parachute (minimum diameter: 2m).

4. **Dispersal Procedure:**  
   - Drop your capsule into the volcano’s mouth at sunrise.
   - The updraft will carry your contribution into the jet stream, where it will eventually land in our in-tray (or somewhere in the Pacific).

## Pull Requests

While GitHub pull requests are technically accepted, they will be **ignored** until the corresponding carrier pigeon or volcano delivery arrives. (This is for your own security and ours.)

## Code of Conduct

- Be kind to pigeons.
- Respect volcano safety protocols.
- No skydiving squirrels, please.

## Questions?

If you have questions, please write them on a slip of paper and tie them to the nearest migratory bird. Response times may vary (allow 3–5 lunar cycles).

Thank you for helping make Gamma Waves a truly high-flying project!
